=======================

Scoring System
==============

* The objective of the game is to finish in as less score as possible.
* Every move adds 1 to the score.
* Time is displayed too, so time can be intepreted as score too.
* There are two levels in the game.

Controls
========

* `WASD` keys are used to move the cuboid intuitively on the tilemap.
* The game mirrors real world physics i.e. the block wont fall untill the greater than half of it is outside the map.
* `o` and `p` to rotate the camera around the target (mostly 0, 0, 0).
* SPACE to change the view from orthogonal to perspective and vice versa.
* `f` for block-view i.e. the camera placed inside the block. `o` and `p` can be used to rotate the camera in this view too.
* `r` for top-view.
* `b` for follow-view i.e. the camera follows the block around the map.
* The same keys i.e. `f, r or b` can be pressed again to goto normal (tower-view).
* Drag around the screen for helicopter view.

Bonus features implemented
==========================

* Beautiful aesthetics
* Multiple levels
* Fragile tiles: Can support the cuboid when horizontal but not when vertical
* Switch/ Bridges: Switch which activates a bridge connecting two parts of the map
* Teleporter: Move to this tile to teleport to another disconnected section of the map
* Music: Music which goes along the game
* Scoreboard displayed which keeps track of score
* Timer which displays time spent playing the game
